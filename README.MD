## INTRODUCTION
Stock_strength_predictor
I designed this project to plot graphs of some 6 S&P 500 stock data.  

# Pipeline
The project involves getting S&P stock data using yahoo finance library, transforming it using Pandas and plotting the real time data using FuncAnimation from Matplotlib.

## Installation
Git clone https://github.com/Richard-code-gig/Stock_strength_predictor to install the package folder.  
Initialise a git folder in the project root directory.  
Activate a virtual environment.  
Run pip -r requirements.txt to install python packages.  
 
## Repository Structure and Run Instructions
./loader.py/ contains scripts associated with extracting stock data from Yahoo Finance.  
./plotter.py/ contains two scripts for plotting the real time graph.  

## Development work
This a simple python application that gets stock data from Yahoo Finance using yahoo_fin library.  
I used simple algorithms to show the strength of selected stocks.  
Some algorithms I used include SMA, Stochastic gradient and RSI.  
The data generated is stored in a csv file and used to plot realtime graphs using matplotlib.
